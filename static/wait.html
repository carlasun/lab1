	<h4>Prototype: Panda Cam</h4>

	<!-- p means paragraph -->
	<p>
		Users can select from a Live Puppy, Kitten, or Panda Cam. They can also choose to donate now or add it to their purchase when they get to the end of the line. After deciding to donate or not, the view goes back to the animal they had selected. Selecting or being promoted to donate while watching the Kitty or Puppy Cam asked if they’d like to donate to the local ASPCA. From the Panda Cam, people would be asked if they would like to donate to the San Diego Zoo. This is meant to be an improvement on the current system in supermarkets in which you’re prompted to donate while at the credit card reader. This usually is a brief bottleneck, and advertising and adding donations to purchases while customers are in line would be a better way to implement this. I choose this idea because I wanted a way to incorporate my favorite animal (the panda) and charity into the idea. </p>

		<h4>User Insights:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>A user pointed out that animals might be sleeping at night, and an option to watch pre-compiled footage should be used. This makes sense, since on my kitty cam prototype, the cat is sleeping. It would get boring fast. </li>
			<li>A female user gushed that she would love to see cute baby animals while waiting in line. I was banking on the internet’s obsession with cats to entertain people in line. </li>
			<li>Another user said this was a good idea for charity, compared to other ideas that were not philanthropic. He said it was the 2nd time he encountered somebody working on the same project. </li>
			<li>Another user sympathized that if the animals looked extra sad, they might get more donations. However, these were much more sympathetic than Sarah McLachlan commercials. He would rather donate to this than those ‘annoying-*** commercials’. I was really glad that the idea beat out those commercials.</li> 
			<li>Another user said it’d be a great way to distract her kids. The future iteration should probably be low enough for kids to interact with. </li>

	<h4>Prototype 2: The Waiting Game</h4>
		<p>People waiting in line participate in a chance to win and be moved to the front of the line. People waiting in line were prompted with the ‘trivia question’ screen then asked to pick a number from 1-6 to simulate the outcome of the competition: the user’s number being called and proceeding to the front, winning and being moved to the front, or losing and playing again while their number continues to move normally. A majority objected to the idea of being forced to play the game and being moved back one space, so another option was added hastily to allow people to choose to wait in a normal waiting list. This made it more confusing, and difficult to test in settings with extremely short lines because people would opt to just wait in the normal line or there wouldn’t really be a point in playing a game if the line was so short. I regret choosing this one to test, but I felt like it was one of my more original ideas. It pretty much crashed and burned. I had originally committed to this idea because I thought people would rather play a trivia game while waiting for their number to be called anyway. The chance to be moved to the front would be based on a skill or knowledge (in this case, trivia), and being moved back one spot in line would not be that much of a loss.

		<h4>User Insights:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>I don’t think I would want to play this game in a really short line. (One of the lines I tested in was a line where we were waiting to be checked off for something by a TA. ) I ran out of time in trying to find a longer line.</li>
			<li>One user didn’t want to be force to play the game. I realized that I should add the option to allow them to opt out of the game and added another possible “line” they could wait in. However, having these options did not seem that attractive. </li>
			<li>Many users objected to the idea of being moved back while waiting in line. One user stated that they didn’t get into line just to be moved back. </li>
			<li>Another person stated that being moved back one space in line was a low risk, so it would be an ok distraction in line. This user gave me hope that not all was lost with this idea. </li>
			<li>One  user was confused by why there were two lines and required further explanation. This shows that the idea may not be fast or intuitive, further proving that it should not be played in short lines.</li>
