	<h4>Prototype: Panda Cam</h4>

	<!-- p means paragraph -->
	<p>Prototype 1: Panda Cam <br>
		Users can select from a Live Puppy, Kitten, or Panda Cam. They can also choose to donate now or add it to their purchase when they get to the end of the line. After deciding to donate or not, the view goes back to the animal they had selected. Selecting or being promoted to donate while watching the Kitty or Puppy Cam asked if they’d like to donate to the local ASPCA. From the Panda Cam, people would be asked if they would like to donate to the San Diego Zoo. This is meant to be an improvement on the current system in supermarkets in which you’re prompted to donate while at the credit card reader. This usually is a brief bottleneck, and advertising and adding donations to purchases while customers are in line would be a better way to implement this. I choose this idea because I wanted a way to incorporate my favorite animal (the panda) and charity into the idea. </p>

		User Insights:
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>A user pointed out that animals might be sleeping at night, and an option to watch pre-compiled footage should be used. This makes sense, since on my kitty cam prototype, the cat is sleeping. It would get boring fast. </li>
			<li>A female user gushed that she would love to see cute baby animals while waiting in line. I was banking on the internet’s obsession with cats to entertain people in line. </li>
			<li>Another user said this was a good idea for charity, compared to other ideas that were not philanthropic. He said it was the 2nd time he encountered somebody working on the same project. </li>
			<li>Another user sympathized that if the animals looked extra sad, they might get more donations. However, these were much more sympathetic than Sarah McLachlan commercials. He would rather donate to this than those ‘annoying-*** commercials’. I was really glad that the idea beat out those commercials.</li> 
			<li>Another user said it’d be a great way to distract her kids. The future iteration should probably be low enough for kids to interact with. </li>
